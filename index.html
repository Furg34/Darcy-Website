<H2 CLASS="western">Introduction</H2>
<P>Hi, thanks for visiting my site. There are numerous sites on this
vast internet, where I have a few profiles filled out. Linked In,
Facebook, Google +, MySpace, Twitter, etc. But, since DarcyAllen.ca
was available, I thought I better grab it and put something here.</P>
<P>So, think of this as a default home for me on the internet. If you
landed here because of a Google search, then great. I hope I stay on
the first page of search results.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Background</H2>
<P>I have one sibling. We were raised on a farm, 17 miles from the
nearest town. We learned to work hard, eat right, and enjoy the
simple things in life.</P>
<P>I did well in school and enjoyed many sports and hobbies growing
up. I played many years of hockey, soccer, rugby, and other sports,
and these activites were the most important things in my early life:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>hiking</P>
	<LI><P>fishing</P>
	<LI><P>horseback riding</P>
	<LI><P>dirtbiking</P>
	<LI><P>drumming</P>
	<LI><P>downhill skiing</P>
	<LI><P>computer programming</P>
</UL>
<P>And then as a young adult, I went straight from high school into
college. I graduated from the College Of New Caledonia with a
Business Administration diploma majoring in C.I.S. (Computer
Information Systems). My first major decision in my life happened
when I had to choose between going on to achieve my bachelor Computer
Science degree at UBC (University Of British Columbia) or start
working. A great opportunity presented itself to me, and so I chose
working at my career as a computer programmer.</P>
<P>To this day, I am still a computer programmer.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What Inspires Me</H2>
<P>People who know me, know that I love mountains, and nature in
general.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">My Philosophy of Life</H2>
<P>Life is good.</P>
<P>Work hard, play hard.</P>
<P>“An open mind is a wonderful thing. A closed mind is a waste of
a mind.”<BR><FONT SIZE=2>-- Darcy Allen</FONT></P>
<P>“The best software design documents are the ones with the
crinkled corners and coffee stains.”<BR><FONT SIZE=2>-- Darcy Allen</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Relationship</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I found and married my soul mate in my
mid twenties. A marriage takes work. Men can not put it on autopilot.
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Family</H2>
<P>All four of my grandparents were fortunate enough to live a full
life. I am glad that I got to know each of them very well.</P>
<P>My parents and sibling are dear to me, and I wish that I could
spend more time with them but we all lead such busy lives and live
far apart.</P>
<P>My wife and I have 3 beautiful children. We are proud of each and
every one of them, for their acheivements, outlook on life, and good
character.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Career</H2>
<P>If I could go back in time, I would choose the same career I have
been doing all my life. I love computer programming. I look for the
good in all hardware, O/S, platforms, and programming languages,
tools, and technologies. Just like humans: nobody is perfect; it is
similar with computers: no one thing is the best thing for every job
in the world. It is generally a good idea to use the best tool for
the job.</P>
<P>To do: I plan on putting some things here, like:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>list of inventions I have made – some published, some half
	done</P>
	<LI><P>wild and crazy ideas</P>
	<LI><P>tutorials of things I am qualified to teach other people</P>
	<LI><P>links to my technical support I have given freely to other
	computer programmers over time, among numerous forums, blogs, and
	developer sites</P>
	<LI><P>my own short stories – some are funny, some are inspiring</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Hobbies and Favourite Activities</H2>
<P>I currently do:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>barbershop quartet singing</P>
	<LI><P>barbershop chorus singing</P>
	<LI><P>downhill skiing</P>
	<LI><P>snowboarding</P>
	<LI><P>dirtbiking</P>
	<LI><P>hiking</P>
	<LI><P>drumming</P>
</UL>
<P>In the past I have enjoyed all of the above, plus some other
things:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>volleyball – beach and indoor</P>
	<LI><P>singing SATB style</P>
	<LI><P>being a true entrepreneur running a high tech startup that
	enjoyed some success</P>
	<LI><P>tree planting</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">The Future</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I have personal goals, and we have
family goals. We work towards our goals every day, except for when we
are on vacation. Let the pull of the future have a great influence on
your current day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">“Where there is life, there is hope.
And where there is hope, there's a dream following behind. Purpose is
the healing balm which enables each of us to face up to adversity and
strife.”</P>
