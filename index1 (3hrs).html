  	<P class="textbox-pad">And then as a young adult, I went straight from high school into college. I graduated from the College Of New Caledonia with a Business Administration diploma majoring in C.I.S. (Computer Information Systems). My first major decision in my life happened when I had to choose between going on to achieve my bachelor Computer Science degree at UBC (University Of British Columbia) or start working. A great opportunity presented itself to me, and so I chose working at my career as a computer programmer.</P>
	<P>To this day, I am still a computer programmer.</P>
